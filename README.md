# displaylink - Debian/Ubuntu install package

Official software distribution transformed into a Debian/Ubuntu package

## Motivation
Dear DisplayLink (as a company) I have the fullest respect about your products and I like your products, but understand we are in 2021 and you can ask for licenses in debian packages when executing the "preinst" script.
Since you distribute your Linux drivers while supporting Ubuntu, I don't see where any other benefits could be...

## TODOs
 * Register an PPA and host packages there
 * Do install and uninstall test
 * Adding evdi dkms package with latest release from Git (Needed to make the displaylink driver work nicely!)
